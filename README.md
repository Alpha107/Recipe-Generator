## Setup & Installation

### Step 1 — Get a Spoonacular API Key

1. Go to [spoonacular.com/food-api](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Copy your API key from the dashboard

### Step 2 — Store Your API Key Safely

Create a `.env` file in your project folder:

```
SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Then load it in `app.py` like this:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
API_KEY = os.getenv("SPOONACULAR_API_KEY")
```

> ⚠️ Never hardcode your API key in the source code. Never commit `.env` to GitHub.

### Step 3 — Install Dependencies

```powershell
pip install streamlit requests python-dotenv
```

### Step 4 — Run the App

```powershell
streamlit run app.py
```

Opens automatically at `http://localhost:8501`

- 🔥 Calories
- 🥩 Protein (g)
- 🍞 Carbohydrates (g)
- 🧈 Fat (g)
- 🍬 Sugar (g)
- 🌾 Fiber (g)

### Price Per Serving
Shown in USD and converted to Nepali Rupees (NPR) at Rs. 140 = $1.

### Dietary Badges
Automatically displayed if the recipe is Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free, or Very Healthy.

## Security Notes

- Store your API key in `.env` only — never in `app.py`
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` before pushing to GitHub
- If your key is ever exposed, regenerate it immediately at [spoonacular.com/food-api/console](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/console)
